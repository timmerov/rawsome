processing order:

1. load raw pixels

2. subtract black

3. fix bad pixels
note: this must be done with canon bayer rgb pixels.
but the algorithm fixes linear rgb pixels.

4. hard-coded camera white balance
note: it's not clear we should do this.

we are now using a linear color space.

5. desaturate pixels
note: need to move this to before the hard coded white balance.
cause red and blue multipliers are around 2.5 and 1.5.
so the saturation point depends on color component.
oops.

6. scale to full 32 bits.

7. demosaic

8. combine greens

apply user tweaks.

9. auto white balance

10. user black and white

11. enhance colors

12. user gamma


convert to display.

13. srgb
note: srgb is a misnomer.
srgb here means convert from canon bayer rgb space to linear rgb space.
srgb actually means to apply the display gamma.

14. display gamma

15. convert to 8 bit.
